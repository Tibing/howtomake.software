Right now most of us are sitting at home because of COVID. I'm at the lockdown too and ought to work from home.

It's almost two months since I've visited the office the last time. Working from home always was a huge pain for me.
So many distractions, so many things to do, so a big room for procrastination! However, approximately a year ago everything
changed and now I believe I'm as productive as if I was working from the office.

At this article I'm introducing the only way to work that made me productive.

## TLDR

- Remove distractions
- Split job into multiple small sub-jobs
- Write down everything you do
- Do it!

## What is the main problem?

As I see it, the main issue is a distraction. When we're working from home we have
a lot more distraction. Don't get me wrong, when we're working at the office,
it's easier to get things done, but we have a distraction too. However, at home,
we have a lot more distractions! Our housemates, interesting and very important
house tasks, youtube (nobody watching you, right?), social networks, and so forth.

And what's most important, nobody watching you and you can do whatever you want,
and you know it. And you're doing it! However, that's not what you really want!
You want to get your tasks done!

Also, when you're at home, there is no right atmosphere. Nobody is working around
and you're at the same place where you eating, getting rest and so on. So, in fact,
it's true - home has no appropriate atmosphere to get your things done.

Because of all of that we can decide that the main issues are:

- Distraction
- Lack of an appropriate atmosphere

But in fact, that's not true. The issue is not in distraction or in the atmosphere.

The real issue in the way **how our brains work**.
