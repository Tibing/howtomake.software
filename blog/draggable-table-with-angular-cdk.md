## What are we going to build?

In this article I'm going to show you how to build a table with an ability to rearrange rows in it. ðŸ‘‡

## What we need for that?

### Angular CDK

All the functionalities we need for the draggable table are bundled inside the Angular CDK package. Let's install it first of all:

```bash
npm install @angular/cdk
```

When the Angular CDK package is installed in your project it's a time to understand what exactly we're going to use from the package.

### Angular CDK Table Module

Since we're building a draggable **table**, the first thing we need is **table** ðŸ™„. Angular CDK Table Module allows us to build powerful tables easily. Let's take a look at how to do that.

First of all, we ought to import the Angular CDK Table into the `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CdkTableModule } from "@angular/cdk/table";

@NgModule({
  imports: [CdkTableModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

`CdkTableModule` allows us to use basic tables primitive directives: `cdk-table`, `cdkColumnDef`, `cdk-header-cell`, `cdk-cell`, etc. Let's discuss, how to use them.

### Create Table

We need to create a table itself. Let's add a plain HTML table and mark it as the Angular CDK Table using `cdk-table` directive:

```html
<table cdk-table></table>
```

Next, we need to configure the table structure. We can do so using directives provided by the `CdkTableModule`. Let's configure each piece one by one:

#### Header row configuration

Header row can be configured using `cdk-header-row`. This directive will let `cdk-table` understand that it's a template for the header row. Then, we're adding a `cdkHeaderRowDef` directive. It receives a list of columns to be shown.

```html
<tr
  cdk-header-row
  *cdkHeaderRowDef="['position', 'name', 'weight', 'symbol']"
></tr>
```

#### Table row configuration

A table row can be configured using `cdk-row`. This directive will let `cdk-table` understand that it's a template for the table row. Then, we're adding a `cdkHeaderRowDef` directive. It receives a list of columns to be shown.

```html
<tr
  cdk-row
  *cdkRowDef="let row; columns: ['position', 'name', 'weight', 'symbol'];"
></tr>
```

#### Table cells configuration

Now, it's a time to configure table cells:

```html
  <ng-container cdkColumnDef="position">
    <th cdk-header-cell *cdkHeaderCellDef> No. </th>
    <td cdk-cell *cdkCellDef="let element"> {{element.position}} </td>
  </ng-container>

  <ng-container cdkColumnDef="name">
    <th cdk-header-cell *cdkHeaderCellDef> Name </th>
    <td cdk-cell *cdkCellDef="let element"> {{element.name}} </td>
  </ng-container>

  <ng-container cdkColumnDef="weight">
    <th cdk-header-cell *cdkHeaderCellDef> Weight </th>
    <td cdk-cell *cdkCellDef="let element"> {{element.weight}} </td>
  </ng-container>

  <ng-container cdkColumnDef="symbol">
    <th cdk-header-cell *cdkHeaderCellDef> Symbol </th>
    <td cdk-cell *cdkCellDef="let element"> {{element.symbol}} </td>
  </ng-container>
```

The most important part here is `cdkColumnDef`. It says which column we're configuring. As you remember, we just told the Angular CDK Table that we'll have the following columns in the table: `['position', 'name', 'weight', 'symbol']`. Now we're using `cdkColumnDef="name"` to tell the table which column we're configuring here. We have pretty similar configurations for all columns. Let's dive inside columns templates.

Inside each column definition, we have two lines: one for the header cell or _th_ and one for the row cell or _td_.

```html
<th cdk-header-cell *cdkHeaderCellDef>Name</th>
```

This line configures a header cell for the _name_ column. It tells the table that it's a header cell via `cdk-header-cell` directive. And marks it as a cell template with `*cdkHeaderCellDef`.

```html
<td cdk-cell *cdkCellDef="let element">{{element.name}}</td>
```

While this line configures how the table row cell will look like. `cdk-cell` marks this element as a table cell. And `*cdkCellDef="let element"` directive marks it as a template and provides the link to the active row `element`.

But where we'll get those elements? Right now we have only the template and nothing similar to data! Hmm. The Angular CDK Table operates with the concept of _datasource_.

### Datasource

#### What is Angular CDK Table data source

The data source concept describes how you can provide data to the Angular CDK Table. It can be done in three ways:
1. The simplest way is to use a plain javascript array. It ought to contain objects. And in that case, each object represents one table row.

2. Using `Observable`. In that case, you ought to provide a stream of arrays. The table will rerender each time that `Observable` emits a new array. (We'll use that approach for the data source in this tutorial).

3. Using `DataSource` object that implements `DataSource` interface that contains `connect`/`disconnect` functions. This approach is useful for more complex scenarios. Especially in cases when you need to clean up our data stream. This can be done using `disconnect` functionality.

#### How to attach data to the table?

First of all let's create an array with data:

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  private items: PeriodicElement[] = [
    {position: 1, name: 'Hydrogen', weight: 1.0079, symbol: 'H'},
    {position: 2, name: 'Helium', weight: 4.0026, symbol: 'He'},
    {position: 3, name: 'Lithium', weight: 6.941, symbol: 'Li'},
    {position: 4, name: 'Beryllium', weight: 9.0122, symbol: 'Be'},
    {position: 5, name: 'Boron', weight: 10.811, symbol: 'B'},
  ];
}
```

Then, we ought to push that data into the subject. That's required since we're going to change the order of rows during the drag and drop.

```typescript 
export class AppComponent {
  datasource = new BehaviorSubject(this.items);
}
```

After that, when we have a stream of data we ought to connect it to the table:

```html
<table [dataSource]="dataSource"></table>
```

![Table demo](/assets/blog/draggable-table-with-angular-cdk/table.png)

And that's it. Now we have a table and a data source connected to it. Now it's a time to make it draggable!

## Adding Drag & Drop

All the functionalities we need for the drag and drop are bundled inside the Angular CDK DragDrop module. So, let's import it first of all:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { DragDropModule } from '@angular/cdk/drag-drop';

@NgModule({
  imports: [DragDropModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

When `DragDropModule` is installed it allows us to use `cdkDrag` and `cdkDropList` directives inside our templates to make elements draggable. Let's see how it works.

### cdkDrag

```html
<tr cdk-row *cdkRowDef="let row;" cdkDrag></tr>
```

This is a table row we defined a few minutes ago. But now I added a `cdkDrag` directive here. This directive makes an element draggable.

### cdkDropList

The next step is to define the container for draggable elements. Since in our case we're going to rearrange table rows, that means our draggable elements container is our table:

```html
<table cdk-table cdkDropList (cdkDropListDropped)="drop($event)"></table>
```

I've just added `cdkDropList` directive here. It marks the table as a draggable elements container and allows us to intercept _drop_ events using `cdkDropListDropped` directive output. So, when the user releases an element somewhere on the table we'll receive that _drop_ event. Then, we'll be able to react on it and rearrange the data in the table's data source.

So, as you can notice above I've added `drop` callback to the `cdkDropListDropped` event. Let's implement it to make our table finally rearrangeable!!

```typescript
import {CdkDragDrop, moveItemInArray} from '@angular/cdk/drag-drop';


export class AppComponent {
  drop(event: CdkDragDrop<string[]>) {

    // Rearrange the data in the array
    moveItemInArray(this.items, event.previousIndex, event.currentIndex)

    // Publish a new version of the data into the datasource
    this.dataSource.next([...this.items]);
  }
}
```

What's going on here? We're just receiving a `CdkDragDrop` event. It contains all the required information to move the item. It has a `previousIndex` and a `currentIndex` of the item that was moved visually by the user. Then, we can move it from the previous place to the new place using the `moveItemInArray` function provided by the Angular CDK DragDrop module.

And finally, we're just publishing a new version of data to the table! Easy as that! And here is the result ðŸ‘‡
