Put logic in templates - why not to put logic in templates if we can? Readability? No, itâ€™s not for us.
You donâ€™t need codestyle/tslint/codelyzer - similar code at all application parts? No, we donâ€™t need it. Everyone ought to write code in their own style.
Never unsubscribe - Forget about it! ðŸ˜… Let's leave that job for the garbage collector, otherwise, why does it exist, right?
State management is not for you - save data at components props.
Donâ€™t OnPush - then, how Angular will update your app?
Donâ€™t use Angular CLI features - schematics/builders/budgets - boring
Pure functions? No, you donâ€™t need it. - testability? Composability? Predictability? No, itâ€™s not for us! Letâ€™s make everything impure, indeed, what could go wrong?
